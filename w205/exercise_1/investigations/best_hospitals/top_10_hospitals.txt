In order to select the best hospitals I combined a number of different measures and found institutions that scored well on all of them.
First I combined all of the readmissions and mortality measure scores to get an average for each hospital and other summary statistics.
Then I did a similar aggregation for healthcare associated infection (HAI) measures and the general comparison ratings for each hospital.
Finally, I joined each of the hospitals to their calculated aggregate scores for readmissions, mortality, HAI, and general comparisons and overall rating.
To identify the "top 10" hospitals based on these scores I limited to samples with above average ratings across every aggregated measure, and overall rating of 5 and then ordered by the mortality score.
The thinking here is to select hospitals that are consistently good across multiple ratings, and then doing a final sort on mortality since it is a particularly important factor.
