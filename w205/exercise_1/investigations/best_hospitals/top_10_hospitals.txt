In order to select the best hospitals I combined a number of different measures and found institutions that scored well on all of them.
First I combined all of the readmissions and mortality measure scores to get an average for each hospital.
Then I did a similar aggregation for healthcare associated infection (HAI) measures and the general comparison ratings for each hospital.
Finally, I joined each of the hospitals to their calcualted aggregate scores for readmissions, mortality, HAI, and general comparisons.
To identify the "top 10" hospitals based on these scores I limited to samples with above average ratings across every aggregated measure, and then ordered by the mortality score.
The thinking here is to select hospitals that are consistently good across multiple ratings, and then doing a final sort on mortality since it is a particularly important factor.
