In order to select the best states I combined a number of different measures and found states that scored well on all of them.
First I combined all of the readmissions and mortality measure scores and calcualted a ratio of better and worse hospitals over total hospitals for each state.
Then I did a similar aggregation for the general comparison ratings for each hospital to create another ratio.
Finally, I joined each of the states to their calculated ratios for readmissions, mortality, and general comparisons.
To identify the "top 10" states based on these ratios I limited to samples with a general comparison ration above the average, and then ordered by the mortality ratio.
The thinking here is to first limit to states that are above average in the general before doing a final ranking on mortality since it is a particularly important factor.
