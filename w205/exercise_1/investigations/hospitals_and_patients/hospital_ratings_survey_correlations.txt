In order to evaluate whether average scores for hospital quality are correlated with patient survey responeses I calculated the correlation between the overall general rating of each hospital with the performance rates and total performance scores from the survey response data.
First I join the hospital rating from the general ratings table with the various metrics in the survey table on provider id.
Then we can calculate the correlation between the ratings and the survey performance.
Our results show that most survey measures are weakly positively correlated with hospital's overall rating.
The survey measures with the highest correlation to hospital ratings was the total performance score and the lowest was communication with doctors.
